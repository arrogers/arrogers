### ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ Hi there, ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸ðŸŒ¸

I'm Anna (she/her), a genomic data scientist at Bayer Crop Science. I work on a variety of projects across plant breeding pipelines, bringing together a background in quantitative genetics, statistics, and plant breeding expertise to connect how we breed to performance in a customer's field. 

ðŸŒ¸ I partner directly with key stakeholders to co-create analytics bridging the gap between theory and practice, resulting in quick model and metric adoption, and clear opportunities for partners to engage in continued analytics development. This has lead to models I develop being used throughout our breeding pipelines all the way to our commercial organization. Some top skills I bring to a team:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸŒ¸ Enabling Data Scientist: Democratizing use of data in breeding pipelines by spending time embedded within key partner teams and bringing their feedback into our tools.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸŒ¸ Stakeholder Partnership: Collaboration from step one to ensure our breeding partners have the tools we need and confidence to use them.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸŒ¸ Mentorship & Service: Focus on giving back to our community through mentoring, serving as a leader internally, and partnering with key external collaborators.  

âœ¨ Problems that excite me:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âœ¨ Developing tailored data visualization tools for communication & democratization of data literacy  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âœ¨ Pairing real-world data with appropriate statistical analyses that meet partner needs and keep things parsimonius
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; âœ¨ Working with limited data to provide context and help design future experiments

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸŒ± About the world of design and how we can better communicate complex information to support breeders.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸŒ± About the commonalities and differences between many crops grown worldwide.  

ðŸ“Š I primarily code in R, Python, and SQL. I also have experience in github, domino, and AWS.   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ“Š Specialty software for breeding: ASReml, Echidna MMS, BGLR  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ðŸ“Š On the side I have dabbled in webscaping, primarily in Python  

âš¡ Fun fact: I'm very into knitting and really enjoy thinking about the math and structures we can use to create!
