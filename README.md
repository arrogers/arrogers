### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Anna (she/her), a genomic data scientist at Bayer Crop Science.

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on using genomic and environmental data to enable breeding decisions.  
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ğŸŒ± About the world of design and how we can better communicate complex information to support breeders.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ğŸŒ± About the commonalities and differences between many crops grown worldwide.  
âš¡ Fun fact: I'm very into knitting and really enjoy thinking about the math and structures we can use to create!
